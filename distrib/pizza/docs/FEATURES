FEATURES

This document briefly describes the features of PiCo. Further
information can be found in the PDF files of this directory.


EXTENSIBLE ALGEBRAIC DATATYPES

PiCo supports extensible algebraic datatypes with defaults. A
motivation for these types can be found in the PDF file icfp01.pdf.
A specification is given by the file eat4j.pdf. It is still a draft
version. All comments are welcome. A more detailed description of
extensible algebraic types for Java including its compilation, is
available only in German at http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~zenger/.


COVARIANT METHOD OVERRIDING

PiCo allows subclasses to override methods of superclasses with
a refined return type (opposed to Java's invariant method over-
riding). Thus, the following code can be legally compiled with
PiCo, even though any Java compiler would reject this program:
	
	class Super {
		Super myself() {
			return this;
		}
	}
	class Sub extends Super {
		Sub myself() {
			return this;
		}
	}


META DATA DEFINITION AND STORAGE

In Java it is difficult to attach meta data to the code compiled
by a regular Java compiler. PiCo supports the doc-comment tag
@meta. Information defined using this tag is stored in the
resulting classfile. In future we will provide tools for
retrieving this information again. Here is an example:
	
	class A {
		/** this is a method declaration
		 *  @meta precond=i>j
		 *  @meta postcond=j>i
		 */
		void foo(int i, int j) {
			int k = i;
			i = j;
			j = k;
		}
	}


ASSERTS FOR J2SDK 1.3

The J2SDK 1.4 introduces assert statements in the Java programming
language. There are two different forms:

    assert <cond>;                or
    assert <cond> : <value>;
    
Assert statements can be activated using the compiler option
-source 1.4. At runtime (if the switch -enableassertions is
activated) an AssertionError occurs if the condition of an assert
statement is false. Since AssertionErrors do not exist in pre 1.4
J2SDKs, code that uses asserts can only run on the J2SDK 1.4
platform. Therefore, PiCo introduces the compiler option
-target 1.3 so that code gets generated that can be executed even
on pre 1.4 J2SDKs.
