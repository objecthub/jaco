____\__ \//  ||//  |____________________________________________________


cJava is an extension of the Java Programming Language. It adds
Compound Types to the language according to the specification of
Martin Buechi and Wolfgang Weck. See
http://www.tucs.abo.fi/publications/techreports/TR182.html
for their technical report "Java Needs Compound Types".

The cJava compiler cjavac is an extension of Jaco, an extensible
Java compiler. This distribution contains two compilers: jaco and
cjavac. jaco can be used as a replacement for Sun's javac whereas
cjavac implements Java + compound types.

For installing the compilers just include the bin directory into
your path.
