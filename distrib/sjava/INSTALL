UNIX

For installing the compiler on Unix systems, you just have
to include the bin directory into your path. With tcsh this
could be done with the following command (assuming that you
installed sjava in directory $HOME/sjava):

  set path=($HOME/sjava/bin $path)

The compiler can be invoked using the command sjavac:

  sjavac MyProgram.sjava
  
Compiled SJava programs are executed using sjava:

  sjava MyProgram


WINDOWS

If you have the possibility: use another operating system!
Microsoft produces low-quality software. Therefore supporting
and using this platform is a pain. If you are forced to use
Windows, then either get a copy of cygwin (http://cygwin.com)
and follow the Unix installation or proceed according to the
following steps:

0) Install the J2SDK (at least JDK1.2)

1) Copy the sjava archive to a directory, say c:\sjava

2) Include the sjava tools in your path by adding the
   entry c:\sjava\bin\win. The procedure for doing this is
   platform specific. Please refer to the instructions
   comming with the J2SDK. You can omit this step, but
   then you have to prefix all sjava tools with
   c:\sjava\bin\win; e.g. the compiler would then be
   invoked with the following command:
   
     c:\sjava\bin\win\sjavac MyProgram.sjava

3) Include the jar files in your classpath

  set classpath=c:\sjava\lib\jaco.jar;c:\sjava\lib\sjava.jar

   Alternatively, you can do it in the same way as step 2).
   
The compiler can now be invoked using the command sjavac:

  sjavac MyProgram.sjava
  
Compiled SJava programs are executed using sjava:

  sjava MyProgram
