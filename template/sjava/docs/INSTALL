UNIX

For installing the compiler on Unix systems, you just have
to include the bin directory into your path. With tcsh this
could be done with the following command (assuming that you
installed sjava in directory $HOME/sjava):

  set path=($HOME/sjava/bin $path)

The compiler can be invoked using the command sjavac:

  sjavac MyProgram.sjava
  
Compiled SJava programs are executed using sjava:

  sjava MyProgram


WINDOWS

If you have the possibility: use another operating system!
Microsoft produces low-quality software. Therefore supporting
and using this platform is a pain. If you are forced to use
Windows, then either get a copy of cygwin (http://cygwin.com)
and follow the Unix installation or proceed according to the
following steps:

1) Copy the archive to a directory, say c:\sjava

2) Include the sjava tools in your path:

  set path=c:\sjava;%path%

3) Include the jar files in your classpath

  set classpath=c:\sjava\lib\jaco.jar;c:\sjava\lib\sjava.jar;%classpath%

The compiler can now be invoked using the command sjavac:

  sjavac MyProgram.sjava
  
Compiled SJava programs are executed using sjava:

  sjava MyProgram
