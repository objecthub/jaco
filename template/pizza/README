JaCo is an extensible Java compiler. It is written in an extension
of itself :-). This distribution contains two compilers: jaco and
pico. pico is an extension of jaco, adding features that support
the development of extensible software. In particular, it features
Java with
  
  * extensible algebraic datatypes,
  * covariant method overriding, and
  * declaration/storage of meta data.

The docs directory contains an introduction to algebraic datatypes
in Java. Both, jaco and pico can be used as a replacement for Sun's
javac. They implement the latest standards defined for the Java 2
Software Development Kit 1.4.

For installing the compilers just include the bin directory into
your path. That's all. Have fun!
