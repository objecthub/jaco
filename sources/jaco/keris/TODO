=======================================================================

RESOLVE:

- class cast to class fields is always possible
- for specialized modules inherit every class field
- generate static main method if main$ gets inherited
- main$ does not get found
- allow 'for' in nested modules only for module specifications
- sealed class fields in interfaces

IMPLEMENT:

- mixin support
- class fields with anonymous definitions


TEST:

- everything
