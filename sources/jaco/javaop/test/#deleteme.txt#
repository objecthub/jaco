English Grammar I:
The structure of English
Tabea Ihsane
Winter Semester
Group 1: Mon. 16-18, A-109 (Aile Jura)
Group 2: Tues. 12-14, L-208 (Landolt)

This seminar presupposes the material taught in the first year 
TP and the first year lecture.

After a brief recapitulation of the first year syntax program 
(argument structure, theta-criterion, X-bar format, government...), 
we will try to provide a systematic description of the English sentence,
identifying the constituents and distinguishing the grammatical 
functions subject and object. While the prototypical subject is 
an NP, subjects may also be realised as PPs or as (small) clauses. 
Because of the subject requirement which stipulates that all English 
sentences must have a subject, expletive subjects may be inserted to 
fill the specifier of IP, the canonical subject position.

The rest of the semester will be devoted to case. The distribution of 
overt noun phrases is regulated by the Case-Filter. In English, case 
is realised morphologically on personal pronouns only. In the
discussion, we will see that the subject function cannot be equated 
with the nominative case. In some contexts, accusative forms can function 
as the subject of non-finite verbs. Different problems
related to the Case-Filter will be addressed in the seminar.

 



English Grammar II:
Movement and Locality
Tabea Ihsane 
Summer Semester Mon. 16-18, L-208 (Landolt)

This seminar presupposes the material taught in the first year TP, 
in the first year lecture and in the winter semester of the 
second year (English Grammar I).

The syntactic mechanism of movement is introduced in this seminar. 
Movement allows us to express a relation between various positions 
in the sentence. Consider (1).

(1) a. I will meet ten ex-students at the party.

b. How many ex-students will you meet at the party?

c. [ How many ex-students ] will you --- meet --- at the party?

By postulating movement of constituents, the sentences in (1) can be 
related and the parallelisms between them brought out. (1c), which is 
the schematic representation of (1b), shows that the direct
object How many ex-students in (1b) is related to the canonical direct 
object position and that the auxiliary will has moved past the subject. 

The analysis of further data will show that there are constraints on the 
type of constituents which can undergo movement and on the position these 
elements can move to. Consequently, a number of principles which constrain 
movement will be elaborated. These constraints can be defined positively or 
negatively: some principles enforce movement whereas others disallow movement.

During the discussion, the triggers of movement, i.e. what enforces movement 
of a constituent will be defined. For instance, (1) suggests that in English 
an interrogative constituent such as How many ex-students must undergo leftward 
movement. Interrogative constituents are said to be operators, they 'operate on' 
or take scope over the entire sentence, determining its illocutionary force, i.e.
whether a sentence is a declarative, an exclamative or an interrogative.

The distance an element can move in the structure has to be defined too. 
While interrogative constituents may move out of declarative sentences, they 
cannot easily move out of indirect questions. All these restrictions on movement 
will be addressed in the seminar. Further locality effects will be examined as well.
